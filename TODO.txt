CODE/RESEARCH
........................................
DONE 1. Make test matrices 
DONE 2. Test C code using test matrices
DONE 3. write SVD 
DONE 4. Write original FD sketch
DONE 5. Compare our FD sketch to python implementaion
DONE: 6. Write batched FD sketch from Huang paper
DONE: 7. Write modified FD from IPCA paper (alpha-sketching)

Things to think about:
How will we write the code to stream in matrix 
    - seems like we won't need to for testing,

we will read and update the sketch at the same time, have to read in chunks at a time 

Optimizations with sparse matrices? There must be something that we can do


WRITING THESIS 
........................................  
1. Look at other theses (Tarik's would be a good example) and see what the breakdown is 

Introduction
    Explain what the goal of sketching is
    what are some applications 
    what are we trying to do/solve
